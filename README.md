# 100DaysOfSwift

## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to all the projects covered in [Paul Hudson's 100 days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100).
Although the projects are mostly same as discussed by Paul Hudson, I have added some additional features which I came across while exploring corresponding topics in depth.

## Projects

Following is the list of all projects. Each project contains following sections:
1. List of topics covered in the project
2. Notes on the topics covered
3. Additional topics explored
4. Challenges
5. Screenshots of the app

### [Project 1](https://github.com/manish-ios/100DaysOfSwift/tree/main/ImageList)
